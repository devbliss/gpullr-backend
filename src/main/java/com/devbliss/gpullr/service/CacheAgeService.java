/**
 * Decides whether our locally stored GitHub data need refresh or are up to date. If yes, a full fetch should be performed, 
 * otherwise it's okay for this application to only listen to events, if not.
 * 
 * The decision is made based on the fact that pulling all events for a certain repo on 2015-02-10 returned
 * events back to 2014-12-17, the oldest event being different depending on the exact time the call was made, 
 * which immediately suggests that there is a soft limit somewhere around 55 days. 
 * Since this value may vary and is not documented, we will go up a bit lower:
